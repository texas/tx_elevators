    <h3>The Data</h3>
    <p>
      Elevator data is available courtesy the Texas Department of Licensing and
      Regulation. To learn more about the data and download the original, visit
      the

      <a href="https://www.license.state.tx.us/ElevatorSearch/HelpPage.asp#data" target="_blank">
        elevator search help page
      </a>.
    </p>
    <p>

      The data isn't perfect. For example, there are {{ future.count|apnumber }}
      elevators listed as being installed after {% now "Y" %}:

      {% for elevator in future %}
        {% if not forloop.last %}
          <a href="{{ elevator.building.get_absolute_url }}">{{ elevator }}</a>.
        {% else %}
          and <a href="{{ elevator.building.get_absolute_url }}">{{ elevator }}</a>
        {% endif %}
      {% endfor %}

      And there are {{ past.count }} elevators that were installed before the
      year 100.

    <h3>Location</h3>
    <p>

      The maps are presented in Google Maps, because they have buildings when
      you zoom in. Using Google Maps also allowed me to use their geocoder. The
      data is only partially geocoded. Only {{ geocoded.count|intcomma }} out of
      {{ buildings.count|intcomma }} buildings have been geocoded and show up
      the map. And of the geocoded buildings, many have inaccurate locations.
